Many of the advertising cookies associated with our service belong to our Service Providers.How can I exercise choice regarding cookies and advertising identifiers?For more information about cookies set through our website, as well as other types of online tracking (including the collection of information by third parties about your online activities over time and across third-party Web sites or online services for online interest based advertising), and to exercise choices regarding them, click here.To opt out of interest-based ads from Netflix in connection with an advertising identifier on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media devices, please configure the appropriate setting on your device (usually found under ""privacy"" or ""ads"" in your device's settings).You may still see Netflix ads on your device, but they will not be tailored to your likely interests.Netflix supports the following self-regulatory programs, which provide additional privacy choices for interest-based advertising:In the US: Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)In Europe: European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA)In Canada: Ad Choices: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC) / Choix de Pub: l'Alliance de la publicité numérique du Canada (DAAC)At this time, we do not respond to Web browser ""do not track"" signals.How Does Netflix use Web Beacons and other Technologies?Web beacons (also known as clear gifs or pixel tags) often work in conjunction with cookies.We and our Service Providers may use them for similar purposes as cookies, such as to understand and enhance the use of our service, improve site performance, monitor visitor traffic and actions on our site, and understand interactions with our marketing (including email and online ads on third party sites).Because web beacons often work in conjunction with cookies, in many cases, declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of web beacons associated with those cookies.We use other technologies that are similar to cookies, such as browser storage and plugins (e.g., HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL).Like cookies, some of these technologies may store small amounts of data on your device.We may use these and various other technologies for similar purposes as cookies, such as to enforce our terms, prevent fraud, and analyze the use of our service.There are a number of ways to exercise choice regarding these technologies.For example, many popular browsers provide the ability to clear browser storage, commonly in the settings or preferences area.see your browser's help function or support area to learn more.Other technologies, such as Silverlight storage, may be cleared from within the application.",netflix,Cookies are required.,['cookies']
