# Domain-Guided-Summarization-of-Privacy-Policies

We share the dataset explained in our paper domain guided summarization of contracts here. 

This dataset was extracted from text of privacy policy, terms of servcie, and cookie policy of several companies. The Points and Plain English Summaries are
extracted from tosdr.org. 

Note that this dataset is automatically annotated. The annotation process is explained in paper "Toward Domain-Guided Controllable Summarization of Privacy Policies". 
Thus, there might be some errors in the assinged risk class (the "Point" column).
