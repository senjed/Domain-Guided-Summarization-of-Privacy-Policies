outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us.And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.Develop new servicesWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones.For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.Provide personalized services, including content and adsWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results.For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products.And Google Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests.For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google.You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to.For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to

are used.For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design.And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns.We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics.When you visit sites that use Google Analytics, Google and a Google Analytics customer may link information about your activity from that site with activity from other sites that use our ad services.Communicate with youWe use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly.For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location.Or we may let you know about upcoming
